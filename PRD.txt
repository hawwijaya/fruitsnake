Product Requirements Document: Fruit Gatherer Game
Introduction and Overview
Fruit Gatherer is a web-based game where players control a squirrel to fetch fruits from a tree and bring them to a basket while avoiding predators. The game features a top-down perspective, colorful graphics, engaging sound effects, and increasing difficulty as the player progresses.

Technical Requirements
Technology Stack
I recommend using JavaScript with the Phaser.js framework for this game. Phaser is specifically designed for 2D web games and provides built-in physics, animation, and sound capabilities.

Visual Requirements
Minimum 256 color palette (8-bit color depth)
Responsive design to work on various screen sizes
Smooth animations for fruit dropping, squirrel movement, and predator behaviors
Clear visual distinction between game elements (tree, fruits, squirrel, basket, snake, worm)
Perspective: 70-degree angle from the ground (top-down but with perspective)

Game Mechanics
Game Setup
A garden scene with grass viewed from a 70-degree angle looking down from the sky
An fruit tree and a basket are randomly positioned on screen
The tree and basket must be at least 75% of the screen size apart
Each game starts with 10 fruits available

Core Gameplay
A fruit drops from the tree near the trunk
A squirrel appears (player-controlled) who must fetch the fruit
The player uses keyboard movement keys (arrows/WASD) to navigate the squirrel to the fruit
Once the squirrel touches the fruit, it picks it up and must carry it to the basket
A snake and a worm spawn and try to steal the fruit (AI-controlled)
The predators move slightly slower than the maximum squirrel speed
The snake grows longer each time it successfully steals a fruit
If the squirrel delivers the fruit to the basket, the player scores a point
If either predator catches the squirrel while carrying the fruit, the fruit is lost
A new fruit appears when the previous one is either delivered, stolen, or lost
The game ends when all 10 fruits are used

Sound Effects

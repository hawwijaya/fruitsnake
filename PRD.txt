Product Requirements Document: Fruit Snake Game
Introduction and Overview
Fruit Snake is a web-based game where players navigate apples from a tree to a basket while avoiding snakes. The game features colorful graphics, engaging sound effects, and increasing difficulty as the player progresses.

Technical Requirements
Technology Stack
I recommend using JavaScript with the Phaser.js framework for this game. Phaser is specifically designed for 2D web games and provides built-in physics, animation, and sound capabilities.

Visual Requirements
Minimum 256 color palette (8-bit color depth)
Responsive design to work on various screen sizes
Smooth animations for apple dropping, snake movement
Clear visual distinction between game elements (tree, apples, snake, basket)
Game Mechanics
Game Setup
A garden scene with grass as the background
An apple tree and a basket are randomly positioned on screen
The tree and basket must be at least 75% of the screen size apart
Each game starts with 10 apples available
Core Gameplay
An apple drops from the tree near the trunk
The player uses keyboard movement keys (arrows/WASD) to navigate the apple
A snake spawns and tries to eat the apple (AI-controlled)
The snake moves slightly slower than the maximum apple speed
If the apple reaches the basket, the player scores a point
If the snake eats the apple, it grows longer
A new apple appears when the previous one is either eaten or enters the basket
The game ends when all 10 apples are used (either collected or eaten)
Sound Effects
